SUMMARY

    FakeDNS is a DNS server which can (and should) be configured to lie about
some DNS records.  Typical use case is to direct a client which has burned in
hostnames (e.g. uiboot.netflix.com) to a different farm for debugging.

USAGE

    Include the fakedns RPM in your image (typically by adding a dependency on
it in your RPM spec); then, add an /etc/fakedns.conf file specifying what names
fakedns should lie about; fakedns will respond to all other queries by looking
up a response and returning it; in other words, it is a fully functional DNS
server (see some caveats below) which responds with true information for any
query OTHER than queries for the recordtype and record names specified in its
fakedns.conf file.

    In any real production use, you'll want to assign an EIP to your instance.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS

    At present, fakedns only listens on UDP; this means that it has no ability
to respond to TCP requests; this also means that requesting something which
would exceed the standard DNS payload size (approximately 512 bytes) will
be problematic, as will be the case of trying to provide a lie that is
unusually big.  If this becomes an actual issue for anyone, feel free to
submit a bug; supporting TCP is not a significant undertaking.

BUGS AND QUESTIONS

    At present, fakedns is owned by Roy Rapoport (rrapoport@netflix.com).  Bugs can be filed against the Cloud Solutions project, 'fakedns' component.
